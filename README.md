# FacialDataAugmentationSystemGUI
In this project, there is a GUI interface that make you can do facial data augmentation based on pre-trained GAN model and weather information, in order to produce more qualified data for trainning ML/AI model. The following figure shows you how the GUI looks like.

# Preparation

1. The following link shows you the code to train a custom CGAN model, https://github.com/edwardchang0112/CRNNCGAN_OnFacialData. You can also use the pre-trained example model in this project to have a try.

2. The weather information used in this project is extracted from https://e-service.cwb.gov.tw/HistoryDataQuery/index.jsp. You can dowload the weather information directly and just remember to change the file name/format to fit this project
